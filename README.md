# My Reads App

## Installation

Run `yarn` and `yarn start` within the main project directory (the same directory as the yarn.lock file)

After running `yarn start` a web page should be open with the app in your OS's default browser. If this is not the case, try to open `localhost:3000` inside your favorite browser.

## Usage

Using the app is very simple. The default page is your bookshelves page. Here you will find 3 bookshelves: Want to Read, Currently Reading, and Read.

You may wish to begin by adding books. In the lower right hand corner you should see the "+ Add Book" button. Click on this button to be brought to a search page where you can try to find the book you wish to add. Type in whatever parameters you wish into the search box, and if a book matches those parameters, it will return some results. For example, typing in "React" gives numerous results.

Simply click on the "Move Book To. . ." button beneath the books to move them to whichever bookshelf you desire. For example, if you click on the button beneath the "React.js Essentials" book and move it to the "Want To Read" bookshelf, you will see it when you return to the bookshelves page.

To return to the bookshelves page, click the "<- Back to Bookshelves" button in the lower right hand corner of the screen, in a similar location that the "+ Add Book" button was.

You can move books around freely between the shelves and they should remain in those shelves if you leave the page and come back, or if you stop the program and restart it.

The ratings that you find beneath each book are the averages of all the ratings. You can see how many people rated each book by looking at the number in parantheses to the right of the average rating. At this time you cannot submit your own ratings.
